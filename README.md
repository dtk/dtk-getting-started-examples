# DTK big data getting started examples
This repo contains getting started examples for using Reactor8's DevOps Toolkit (DTK) for managing big data deployments.
The focus of this guide are on following the examples in [example-services directory] (https://github.com/dtk/getting-started-examples/tree/master/example-services) and start with the Spark getting started examples. included also for reference are the [DTK service and component modules] which contain the service specific logic that powers the available automation and mn management logic. These examples focus on using theses modules as opposed to a write up that describes how a user can create, import, and modify theses modules to address the management of big data or a wide variety of other stacks.
