# DTK big data getting started examples
This repo contains getting started examples for using Reactor8's DevOps Toolkit (DTK) for managing big data deployments.
The focus of this guide is having the user follow the examples in [example-services directory] (https://github.com/dtk/getting-started-examples/tree/master/example-services). The user should start with the Spark examples. Included also for reference are the [DTK service and component modules] (https://github.com/dtk/getting-started-examples/tree/master/modules), which contain the relevant service-specific logic that powers automation and other actions for the example Spark and Ignite clusters. This write up, however, focuses on using theses modules as opposed to a focus that describes how a user can create, import, and modify these and new modules to address the management of a wide variety of big data and other stacks.
